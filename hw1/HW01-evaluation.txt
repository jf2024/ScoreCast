Comments:
---------

problem 4.2 the critical path should be G -> D -> E -> M -> Q making 32 days.

problem 4.4 you are starting your schedule on Monday when the problem states
   that January 1 is a WEDNESDAY.  You also are not allowing for specified
   holidays so your developers will not be happy.

problem 5.9 your "won't" goals might add some fun to the game, but I can see
   how they would be more difficult and so would be stretch goals or be left
   out completely...

Good job on this one!!  Keep up the good work........
