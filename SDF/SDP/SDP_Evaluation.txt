Software Development Plan Document:

-- General Comments
   Nice work on this document!  The group is doing well.

   You should use PRESENT TENSE in your documents.  Don't say what your
   application WILL do, say what it DOES do.  This is a VERY common mistake
   that even experienced authors make!  For example:

   you have:
      The bot will allow users to submit their predictions, earn points
      based on the accuracy of their forecasts, and engage with other users.

   consider instead:
      The bot allows users to submit their predictions, to earn points based
      on the accuracy of those predictions, and to engage with other users.

   This is sprinkled all through your documentation so try to make these
   corrections.

-- Introduction Section
   Good job on this section, nothing to change, no additional comments.

-- Project Resources Section
   Good job on this section also, nothing to change, no additional comments.

-- Project Organization Section
   Same comment here, nothing to change, no additional comments.

-- Project Schedule Section
   The schedule is difficult to read because of the black background.  It's
   better to have black on white rather than white on black so that the
   duration bars can be seen.  Further, you might consider putting this on
   a separate section so you can turn that page to landscape mode for more
   clarity.

   The task/resource table is good, although some of the information is a
   bit redundant to other sections.  You can try to make that less so in the
   next iteration.  Be sure to check your spelling and grammar though.  You
   have "Who Working on it" which could be better as "responsible person" or
   even just "team member".

your score:  9.5% out of 10% = 95% which is an A

Another good job here!

Make the changes as suggested above, including many more requirements for
the second submission and you'll get the full 10% on this document.
