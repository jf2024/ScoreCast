# WondoBot

WondoBot provides a platform on Discord for fans of the San Jose Earthquakes to predict the outcomes of football games. This Discord bot awards points to users based on the accuracy of their predictions in comparison to actual game results. By integrating seamlessly with the San Jose Earthquakes Discord Server, this bot creates a centralized hub where fans can come together to discuss, speculate, and anticipate the outcomes of upcoming matches. Moreover, a list of users that have the highest score based on their prediction is displayed, and a lot more that will be discussed.

### Below are some pictures of some commands that a user can type and its output:

**`/predict-help`** gives an outline of the commands that users can type in and an explanation behind the scoring system

Join this discord server [here](https://discord.gg/JqzU9sx9JS) so you can try out the bot as well!

Quick note: The bot should be online and you can type away with the commands as much as you like! (just give it a second to type in between commands). If you receive an error, that means the server/host where the bot is being hosted on went down for maintenance or other updates. If that's the case, just ping Jose (who on the server is @ninjabathat27) and he can come online to check the server where the bot is located to make sure it works or run the bot locally on his machine and you can use the bot as normal.
