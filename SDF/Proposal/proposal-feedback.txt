CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
Henry Benso, Jose Fuentes, and Edward Halim
Wondobot Discord bot project
==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   Nice work on the document.  The description is at high enough level to
   give the reader an overview, and yet low enough level to let the reader
   know what some of the planned technologies are that you are using, and
   what they will be used for.

   While I understand the focus on the "home team", I'm wondering if you'll
   plan to incorporate other teams' iinformation as well, or only focus on
   the Earthquakes?

   Let me know when you get your Discord server set up so I can join it!

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Good job on the presentation!  The slides look great, your justification
   of both the project goals and the applicability to the course are well-
   thought-out and clear.  I like your use of graphics as well, especially
   the cheering section!  Just an idea, see if you can edit that picture to
   have the banners read something about your project!  :grin:


=============================================================================
your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus

Great job on this presentation and proposal and great start to the semester!
