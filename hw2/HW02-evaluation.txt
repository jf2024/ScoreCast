Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.

on 5.1, I think components are different than service-oriented, because in
the latter case, the parts are independent programs that run as services to
give the application its functionality.  In a component architecture, the
components operate as part of the whole, rather than as independently as
applications.

Excellent and complete job on 5.2, 5.4, and 5.6 ~ good critical thinking!

Interesting way to divide things on 5.8 ~ making it two parts is smart and
I can see your logic there...

Not bad on the drawings, BTW, but as professional as the rest of your work
is on this, I'd respectfully suggest you download a drawing application of
some kind, or perhaps invest in a ruler to draw straight lines... :D

....just sayin'....

Good job ~ you guys are doing great so far!!  Keep it going.......
