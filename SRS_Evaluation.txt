Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   Nice work on this section!  Nothing to add here.  The diagram is great!

-- Functional Requirements
   Be careful of "weasel words" like "user friendly" and "intuitive" in your
   documents.  What is intuitive to you may not be to me.  Your requirements
   should be worded with "shall", with each requirement being numbered.  Use
   of a bulleted list is discouraged unless it's part of a "will" or "should"
   statement.  For example:

   2.1 Score Prediction Submission
      Users will be able to submit their score predictions for upcoming San
      Jose Earthquakes football games through Discord.  The submission process
      will be done so that users can easily determine the operations without
      needing to refer to a help screen or user guide document.
   2.1.1 Predictions Timeframe
      2.1.1.1  Users shall have a limited amount of time to enter predictions.
      2.1.1.2  Entry time shall begin 20 minutes prior to the start of a game.
      2.1.1.3  Entry time shall end 5 minutes prior to kickoff.
      2.1.1.3  Users shall not be allowed to submit predictions once the game
               has started.

-- Performance Requirements
   This section is good, but the same comment applies about "shall" language.

-- Environment Requirements
   This section is good, but the same comment applies about "shall" language.


=============================================================================
your score:  8% out of 10% which is a B

All in all, not a bad first effort, you just need to fill in more specifics.
Your 'requirements' do not use requirements language ~ for a waterfall style
document you need to have "shall" statements for the requirements.

Make the changes as suggested above, including many more requirements for
the second submission and you'll get the full 10% on this document.
